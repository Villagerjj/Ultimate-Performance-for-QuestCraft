Hello! Villagerjj here, this version of UPQC has a new way of installation.

TLDR:
Lite - as close to vanilla as possible, no extra quality of life stuff. this is the "foundation" ALWAYS INSTALL THIS
Normal - includes enhancements, and is recommended if you only play singleplayer. add this to get quality of life stuff.
Multiplayer - add this to get optimized multiplayer support.
Bug fixes:
No weather effects - use to fix crosshair vanishing (for those with the "lite" install)
particle rain - use to fix crosshair vanishing (for those with the "Normal" install)

Long install guide: 

If you want Ultimate performace without ANY modifications to the vanilla gameplay, drag the contents of
the "lite" folder to your mods folder.

If you want some improvements like dynamic lighting, and sound physics, drag the "lite" AND "normal" folder
contents to your mod folder.

and if you want better multiplayer, add the mods in the "multiplayer" folder.
