# Ultimate-Performance-for-QuestCraft
Various mods to make quest craft run faster, and without modifying the vanilla experience. All mods are meant to be client side, though some mods are to help with servers that have server and client performance mods. I have tested out this mod pack on singleplayer, and multiplayer. The performance may or may not be noticeable, depending on what quest you are using.  

Step 1:
Delete all of the default mods in your QuestCraft Mod Directory located here: android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch.debug/files/.minecraft/mods

Step 2:
take all jar files stored in the zip and drop them in the folder (same as above) located here: android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch.debug/files/.minecraft/mods

The most recent version of UPQC has been tested on QuestCraft Version 1.1.1
(minecraft version 1.18.1)
