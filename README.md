# Ultimate-Performance-for-QuestCraft
Various mods to make quest craft run faster, and without modifying the vanilla experience. All mods are meant to be client side, though some mods are to help with servers that have server and client performance mods. I have tested out this mod pack on singleplayer, and multiplayer. The performance may or may not be noticeable, depending on what quest you are using.  

Improvments:
Fixed crosshair disapearing (it was rain that caused it)
crash system that tells you what mods caused a crash
mod manager
cool grass
dynamic lighting
optimized chests/block entities
improved multiplayer performance (using krypton)

Installation:

Step 1:
Delete all of the default mods in your QuestCraft Mod Directory located here: android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch.debug/files/.minecraft/mods

Step 2:
take all jar files stored in the zip and drop them in the folder (same as above) located here: android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch.debug/files/.minecraft/mods

The most recent version of UPQC has been tested on QuestCraft Version 1.1.1
(minecraft version 1.18.1)

Best way to configure ingame settings for optimal performance:

Reduce resolution to 30%, and render distance to 0.1 - Pojav settings
change render distance to 5-6 chunks (depends on what quest model you have)
change biome blending to lowest setting
set lamb dynamic lights to fastest
