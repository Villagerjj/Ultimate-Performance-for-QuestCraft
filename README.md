# Ultimate-Performance-for-QuestCraft
Various mods to make quest craft run faster, and without modifying the vanilla experience. All mods are meant to be client side, though some mods are to help with servers that have server and client performance mods. I have tested out this mod pack on singleplayer, and multiplayer. The performance may or may not be noticeable, depending on what quest model you are using.

Best way to configure ingame settings for optimal performance:

change render distance to 5-6 chunks (depends on what quest model you have) set lamb dynamic lights to fastest

## Q&A

Q: Does this modify any vanilla aspects of the game? 

A: short answer, not really.

Q: why does it crash? 

A: open an issue if it persists after trying a reinstall.

Q: What does this do? 

A: it improves QC's performance through fabric mods. and depending on the version of UPQC it will fix a few bugs as well.

Q: My game is still lagging/is lagging more what do I do? 

A: remove some of the Qol mods (like dynamic lights or sound physics), and or increase RAM to 2080 MB

Q: Can I use resource packs with this? 

A: yes, but only if it modifies textures and does not go above 32x32 textures. anything else will cause a softlock.

Q: Will you update this modpack to 1.19? 

A: perhaps. I will port it once QC is ported to 1.19, and most mods are ported as well.

Q: Sex mod? 

A: no, that would be bad.

Q: How is the performance? 

A: normal QC is around 45-65 fps. with this modpack you can expect a 15-35 fps gain. (depends on settings, modpack version, and world type)

Q: This modpack broke my QC install 

A: this should not happen with any version of the UPCQ modpacks. It was most likely an extra mod/resource pack you installed. to fix this you will have to delete all of pojav/QC and reinstall it.

Q: does this include sodium? 

A: not until the QC devs port it.
