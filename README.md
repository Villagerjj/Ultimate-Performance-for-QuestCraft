# Ultimate-Performance-for-QuestCraft
Various mods to make quest craft run faster, and without modifying the vanilla experience. All mods are meant to be client side, though some mods are to help with servers that have server and client performance mods. I have tested out this mod pack on singleplayer, and multiplayer. The performance may or may not be noticeable, depending on what quest you are using.  

Step 1:
Delete all of the default mods in your QuestCraft Mod Directory located here: android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch.debug/files/.minecraft/mods

Step 2:
take all jar files stored in the zip and drop them in the folder (same as above) located here: android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch.debug/files/.minecraft/mods

The most recent version of UPQC has been tested on QuestCraft Version 1.1.1
(minecraft version 1.18.1)

Information:
This modpack contains all of the recomended mods from here:https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/QuestCraft#Recommended-mods
I have added extra mods designed to help with the main factors of lag.
I do not own any of these mods

Optional features:
better dropped items - this simply removes the spinning animation of items on the ground and makes them sideways (improves realism and performance)
lamb Dynamic lights - basically  from optifine, but with an options to make it faster (is super fast combined with starlight)

You can remove these features by deleting the following .jars:
betterdroppeditems-1.3.1-21w37a.jar
lambdynamiclights-2.1.0+1.17.jar
