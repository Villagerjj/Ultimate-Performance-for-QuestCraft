# Ultimate-Performance-for-QuestCraft
Various mods to make quest craft run faster, and without modifying the vanilla experience. All mods are meant to be client side, though some mods are to help with servers that have server and client performance mods. I have tested out this mod pack on singleplayer, and multiplayer. The performance may or may not be noticeable, depending on what quest you are using.  

(v2) Improvments:
Fixed crosshair disapearing
optimized rain
Better sound engine
Optimized redstone
removed tutorial stuffs
mod menu
cool grass
dynamic lighting
optimized chests/block entities
improved multiplayer performance (using krypton)

Installation:

preperation:
you need a way to view/modify your quests internal files
you also need a quest

Step 1:
Delete all of the default mods in your QuestCraft Mod Directory located here: android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch.debug/files/.minecraft/mods

Step 2:
take all jar files stored in the zip and drop them in the folder (same as above) located here: android/data/net.kdt.pojavlaunch.debug/files/.minecraft/mods

The most recent version of UPQC has been tested on QuestCraft Version 1.1.1

Best way to configure ingame settings for optimal performance:

Reduce resolution to 30% in the Pojav settings. this does not effect visual quality, but still improves performance.
change render distance to 5-6 chunks (depends on what quest model you have)
change biome blending to lowest setting
set lamb dynamic lights to fastest
